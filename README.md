## üåå Mission Control for Cosmos Network Upgrades

**Cosmos Upgrades UI** is your real-time dashboard for tracking and managing upgrades across the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This modern web application ensures validators, developers, and token holders stay informed about critical blockchain upgrade events, helping to maintain network stability and coordination.

Built with the latest web technologies and a sleek, user-friendly interface, Cosmos Upgrades UI bridges the gap between complex blockchain infrastructure and the people who depend on it.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Upgrade Tracking**: Monitor upcoming upgrades across all Cosmos-based networks
- **Chain Status Dashboard**: At-a-glance view of mainnet and testnet chains with upgrade status
- **Cosmovisor Support**: Direct links to cosmovisor binaries for automated upgrades
- **Personalized Watchlist**: Save your favorite chains for easy monitoring
- **Webhook Notifications**: Configure Discord/Slack alerts for upcoming upgrades
- **Responsive Design**: Perfect experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with popular Cosmos wallets (Keplr, Leap, etc.)
